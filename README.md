## rules
1. The game starts when the dealer signals “place your bet”. The player or the banker is predicted to win, and chips are placed in the betting area for this game. You can also bet on a tie at this time.
2. Betting may continue until the casino dealer signals “no more bets”. Once betting is closed, the banker and player are each dealt two cards.
3. The sum of these two cards to the first place is the score, and the one closest to 9 wins. However, 10 and picture cards are counted as 0 points.
4. If the player and the banker both score 8 or 9, the game is won or lost at that point, but another card can be added if it is a specific number. For example, in the case of the player, if the total number is between 0 and 5, one card is added to both players. The banker, on the other hand, adds one card to both players when the total number is between 0 and 2.
5. When the third card is dealt, this is where the winner is determined. The bettor who bets the total number closest to 9 wins and receives a payout equal to his or her wager. If you bet on the player to win, your stake is doubled; if you bet on the banker to win, your stake is multiplied by 1.95. If you bet on a tie, your stake is multiplied by 8.
